    							<TextBox x:Name="RTB_Welcome" Margin="3,0,3,3" IsReadOnly="True" Text="Welcome to Rawr.DPSWarr!&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;This module is designed for Warriors hoping to fulfill the DPS role in a raid, either as Fury or Arms Specialized.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;To begin, assuming you have already imported your character from either Character Profiler or the WoW Armory, select your talent specialization above as either Fury or Arms if it did not do so automatically. If you would like to check your numbers against information from the next patch (at present, this is 3.2.2) you can check that item.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Next, jump over to the Fight Info Tab to set some background rules for the fight you want to measure against.&#xd;&#xa;- Lag is the average Latency reported in your WoW client. Many with broadband connections usually see a value between 100 ms and 200 ms. Those with slower connection types such as dial-up will see much larger numbers.&#xd;&#xa;- Reaction is the average amount of time it takes for you (the player) to react to a button that becomes available. For example, when an opponent dodges and the Overpower ability procs, how long does it take you to process this mentally and command your finger to push the hotkey for Overpower. The WoW client gives 250 ms (1/4 second) allowance for this before your reactions count against you. Most players fall under this 250 ms rule.&#xd;&#xa;NOTE: Lag and Reaction are combined into a single calculable value. Small adjustments to these numbers yield *very* small adjustments in your DPS.&#xd;&#xa;- The Boss Selector is a new method of using defined Presets for your 'Situational' settings. Selecting a specific boss will tailor the Duration, in back time, multiple targets etc to what is necessary for that fight. Please note that as this is a new method, many of the values for the presets still need to be fine-tuned.&#xd;&#xa;- Target Level can be changed from 80 to 83. 83 is the numeric representation of all Raid Bosses (who show themselves as Level '??')&#xd;&#xa;- Target Armor is currently defaulted to 10,643 for all Level 83 Bosses. This is the currently accepted rule of thumb and there is little reason to change off of this.&#xd;&#xa;- Fight Duration is the length of the fight in seconds. A value of 600 is 10 minutes. Most boss fights take 6 minutes (value 360) or less but we left a high upper value for those wanting to see total damage for a greater period of time. The maximum for this box is 20 minutes, just above KT's Enrage Timer, which is a value of 1200.&#xd;&#xa;- The Situational boxes provide the basic situation you will normally be fighting in. The default setting should be all disabled except 'Standing in Back' at 100%. See the Advanced Instructions (the next tab over from this one) for more info on these settings.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Finally, go to the Ability Maintenance Tab and choose the abilities you will be maintaining during your battles. Note that changing one or the other can have serious effects on your total DPS output, and some abilities act differently if you are in different situations. For example, Bladestorm will have a much larger DPS number if there are multiple targets throughout the fight.&#xd;&#xa;NOTE: If you have Flooring active, turn it off unless you really want to see what it does. The methods behind it have not been refined and it is presently not as accurate as having it disabled." TextWrapping="Wrap" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto" Grid.ColumnSpan="4"/>

    							<TextBox x:Name="RTB_Advanced" Margin="3" IsReadOnly="True" Text="This section is for advanced users only, most players do not need to concern themselves with these settings.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Since you have gotten your feet wet, looked at your gear, maybe even run an optimization or two, now you must be hungry for more. Fear not, there's plenty more you can tweak with your character.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;The Fight Info Tab&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;We will be adding functionality to maintain damage taken, for survivability and for the additional rage generated from damage taken at some point, but time takes time.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;The Situational Boxes on The Fight Info Tab&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;This tab holds information regarding how often in a fight your toon is in that particular situation. Presently, there are five options with individual settings for each:&#xd;&#xa;- Standing in Back: You spend at least x% of the fight standing behind the target. Mobs are unable to parry or block attacks from behind so the ~13% of attacks that could normally be parried are no longer on the table. If you are not standing behind the mob during for any portion of the fight, Expertise will have additional value due to it preventing Parries.&#xd;&#xa;- Multiple Targets: Your encounter has additional mobs within melee striking distance for x% amount of time. This provides usefulness for abilities such as Cleave, Bladestorm, Whirlwind, Sweeping Strikes to start 'doing their thing' and allowing you to hit the additional targets for a greater overall DPS. Boss fights like Patchwerk however, do not have additional targets. There is a cap for the number of targets placed so that abilities such as Whirlwind do not go for 4 targets worth of damage when there are only 2 targets.&#xd;&#xa;- Moving Targets: Your encounter has a target that moves out of melee striking distance for x% amount of time. This provides usefulness for abilities such as Charge and Intercept and talents which enable these abilities. This also provides effectiveness for Move Speed Enchants like Cat's Swiftness. A good example of this situation is 'Archavon the Stone Watcher' in the 'Vault of Archavon (VoA)'. [Currently this functionality is only active for Arms, not Fury, Charge, etc abilities are not yet modeled]&#xd;&#xa;- Stunning Targets: Your encounter has a target that either stuns just yourself or your entire raid  x times over the fight duration for y milliseconds (1000 = 1 second). This provides usefulness for abilities such as Every man for Himself (Humans) and the talent Iron Will. You can change the values of both boxes by changing one of them. E.g.- Set Percentage to 25% and it will change the seconds box to match and vice-versa. [Currently this functionality is only active for Arms, not Fury]&#xd;&#xa;- Disarming Targets: Your encounter has a target that disarms your characters' weapon periodically in combat. This provides usefulness for things like Titanium Weapon Chain and the talent Weapon Mastery. Most bosses do not do this, but there are several groups of trash (namely in Karazhan) that will disarm players. [Currently, this functionality has not been implemented, though it will be coming soon.]&#xd;&#xa;Additional Situations to manage will be coming soon.&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;The Ability Maintenance Tab&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;Select additional abilities to watch how they affect your DPS. Thunder Clap applies a debuff to bosses as do Sunder Armor, Demoralizing Shout, Shattering Throw, etc." TextWrapping="Wrap" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto"/>

Now settles Cleaves used vs Heroic Strike with Multiple Targets Percent for Arms (Fury still needs to adopt this)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Heroic Strike and Cleave to Verbose Tooltip&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed the issue with Available Rage being shown on the panel as negative.&#xd;&#xa;- Added Survivability Calcs: This is Health / 100 + Heals Per Sec (HPS) that comes from self abilities (Second Wind, Enraged Regen, etc.). You can scale the effect using the Options Panel (set to 0 to ignore Survivability).&#xd;&#xa;- Made Changes to Fury Iter to settle Cleave in with HS and Bloodsurge. This was to fix a performance issue and Ebs needs to review&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed the bug that makes the Titan's Grip talent show massive negative DPS. Needed to add a lot more checks for OH stuff to require TG.&#xd;&#xa;- Added Enraged Regeneration to Ability Maintenance Tree.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Jothay's attempt to put multipletargets in fury :P Multiple Targets should now work properly in both arms and fury.&#xd;&#xa;- Oops, forgot to save a file :x&#xd;&#xa;- Added better logic to Enchant Fits in Slot checks for MH/OH&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the defaults for the Options panel to 100% in back, multitargs off and stunning off&#xd;&#xa;- Sweeping Strikes wasn't playing nice with my changes earlier&#xd;&#xa;- Fully removed the Trinket GCD system&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Sweeping Strike's chance to new attack table&#xd;&#xa;- Added Paragon support (Death's Verdict/Choice)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Rampage Talent Handling&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Trinket and other SpecialEffects trigger intervals to operate more on actual ability usage numbers&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked Ability Proc'g to operate more on actual ability usage numbers&#xd;&#xa;- Added Rage Gains from Sword Spec hits&#xd;&#xa;- Added Rage Slip effect to a couple of abilities that weren't using it&#xd;&#xa;- Adjusted Dual Wield Specialization Bonus application&#xd;&#xa;- Remodeled the following abilities to operate as SpecialEffects: Flurry, Wrecking Crew, Rampage, Trauma.

I've tested both arms and fury for right now&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Ebs's commit (one of the files was conflicting on his attempt to commit)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with displayed information which occurred after rotation refactoring&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with Bladestorm which occurred after rotation refactoring&#xd;&#xa;- Simplified usage of use OH checks&#xd;&#xa;- Added MovementSpeed as a relevant stat&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a slight bug with the new useOH method&#xd;&#xa;- Enabled Moving Targets, change the box from a Percentage to a Number of Seconds. This box is clipped by Duration (can't set a higher value than what Duration is at). Making the necessary code for Arms to make use of this box next.&#xd;&#xa;- Improved reliability of saved options recovering on the Panel by using an isLoading check found in several models.&#xd;&#xa;- Added a Percentage box to Moving Targets time. This relates directly to the other box (adjust one and it adjusts the other). Also when Fight Duration is updated, adjusts Move Time (seconds) by Move Time (%)&#xd;&#xa;- Added BossHandler usage: Users can now use the Boss Selection drop-down to change their Situational stuff (Moving, Stunning, Multiple Targets) to presets based upon boss fights or use one of the Special Bosses.&#xd;&#xa;- Swapped name list to use BetterBossNames (better for sorting)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with Stunning targets where if freq is set to 0, you will get a NaN error.&#xd;&#xa;- Added Boss info box, updates using GenInfoString. TODO: Make it gen a new string based upon custom settings&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.14 (Aug 30, 2009 07:18)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a couple of stat roundings&#xd;&#xa;- Fix for issue 13873 &quot;Target level does not affect yellow hit cap&quot;. Hit cap is now affected by target level in the Options Pane. This is reflected both in calculations and in the Hit can free/more hit needed tooltip.&#xd;&#xa;- Added a Bounds Check to ensure character files created pre-v2.2.12 can be loaded into current version&#xd;&#xa;- Modified CombatFactors to use the new StatConversion for target level adjustment handling&#xd;&#xa;- Applied patch 3631 (T9 set bonuses)&#xd;&#xa;- Applied patch to fix Warrior T9 set bonuses&#xd;&#xa;- Fix for Issue 13901, Bloodrage no longer pulls GCDs&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the Tier Set bonuses (7,8,9). This fixes the Haste proc, and the double-dipping for the T9 bonuses created by last commit.&#xd;&#xa;- Little bit of code reorganizing&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the perc optimizer requirements to translate percentages&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Armor calculations, was not properly using the difference between Base Armor and Bonus Armor and their respective multipliers.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed MultiTargs Handling: It was double-dipping in some places and not being consistently handled. Now if you have MultiTargs checked but at 0% you will see same numbers as if it were unchecked and it scales up to 100% correctly.&#xd;&#xa;- Added Max Targets to MultiTargs Handling: This places a limit on how much extra damage goes out for hitting additional targets, otherwise it will use max (up to 8).&#xd;&#xa;- Updated Glyph bonuses for Battle and Commanding Shout to 3.2&#xd;&#xa;- Added Glyph of Command as Relevant for DPSWarr, it affects the GCD usage of Comm Shout&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Commanding Shout's naming, etc and it now pulls GCDs properly when maintained&#xd;&#xa;- Added Stun Handling (Arms Only). The Selector on the Options Panel is now active and can be used as a percentage of the fight while stunned (recommend using low numbers as very few fights have more than a couple of stuns over the entire fight).&#xd;&#xa;- Added Iron Will Handling (Reduces number of GCDs lost to a stun)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Second Wind Handling (Arms Only) (pops when getting Stunned)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Every Man for Himself Handling (Humans Only) (Arms Only). Recovers GCDs lost to Stuns.&#xd;&#xa;- Added Heroic Fury Handling (Talent Only) (Arms Only). Recovers GCDs lost to Stuns.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Reloading of Saved options from the Options Panel, grouped function calls was causing it to set the first item or two, then an event would trigger and break the rest of the settings.&#xd;&#xa;- SpecialEffect procs now include hasted white attacks, not just unhasted.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug where swordspec was giving negative DPS if you weren't equipping a sword -- should have been 0 dps change.&#xd;&#xa;- Did some more work on the Verbose Tooltip, cleaning it up and having it hide parts of the table that are 0.&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the defaulting values in the Target Armor box&#xd;&#xa;- Added more abilities to the Verbose Tooltip (Bloodsurge, Bloodthirst, Whirlwind, Thunder Clap, Shattering Throw)&#xd;&#xa;- Removed Block from the Attack Table until proof can be shown of bosses in WotLK that block player's attacks&#xd;&#xa;- Added more verification for Swordspec to ensure it's not affecting anything without a Sword equipped.&#xd;&#xa;- Added Fall-through logic for Cleave and Heroic Strike. If MultiTargs is active and Cleave is not being maintained, you will Heroic Strike instead. There is currently not a half-way option yet.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Overpower so it cannot be Blocked&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Targets display for Bladestorm&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Targets for Hamstring, Shattering Throw, Retaliation&#xd;&#xa;- Turned off GCD Usage for Trinkets with Trigger.Use Effects&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed handling for internal Blood Frenzy (Buff Blood Frenzy stays the same)&#xd;&#xa;- Added White Attacks to the Verbose Tooltip method&#xd;&#xa;- Added Combat Table class to DPSWarr: Migrated all attack table related calls to this new class, now handles Crit cap against Glancing and other similar extreme ratings levels&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug where Crits were getting an extra 100% damage&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug in the Rage formula for Unbridled Wrath&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a couple of abilities that had Crit on their attack table when they aren't capable of Critting&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug in Sudden Death and Overpower abilities activating when not being maintained&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the Activates for Overpower, no longer breaks on extremes&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked Rend activates to handle Rend Ability not landing. If it's dodged, etc on the application, player must redo Rend to get it on the target as Rend needs 100% uptime for Taste for Blood. (This adds value to hit and expertise)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed several BuffEffects to operate on Attack Tables. If the debuff &quot;misses&quot; the ability is degraded. Will add reapplication checks (like Rend does now) later.&#xd;&#xa;Note to DPSWarr Users: New testing in Arms shows an optimize for Max DPS without any requirements will now place you within a gem's reach of Hit and Expertise caps. I've seen it forgo 4 hit rating (from cap) in favor of 8 STR or ArP, same on Expertise. Higher Standing in Back increases the likelihood STR will override Exp. Whether this affects Fury the same way remains to be seen by Ebs.&#xd;&#xa;- Now supports softcap with Grim Toll and Mjolnir Runestone (note: wearing BOTH trinkets is not yet supported).&#xd;&#xa;- Performance improvements&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the tooltips for Hit and Expertise, you will now see better values and the differences in caps for 2h vs DW (hit) and Dodge vs Parry (Exp). Also takes better account for other bonuses towards the caps.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Bonus Armor procs not providing AttT bonus. This allows handling for Indestructible Potion&#xd;&#xa;- Attempt to correct issue with Options panel not showing same values as back end. Users may need to uncheck/recheck options in some cases to assert the values.&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Allow Flooring Default to false.&#xd;&#xa;- Possible fix for issue 13977. When some options, gear, etc are changed DPSWarr hangs. Added a loop counter to the OP/SD/SL/SS settler to stop it at 100 loop iterations if it hasn't already finished&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.13 (Aug 12, 2009 02:28)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Updated the Tooltips for Warrior Abilities&#xd;&#xa;- Updated Talent and Glyph trees for 3.2&#xd;&#xa;- Updated Base Stats for Warriors&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the Optimizer fields to a smaller set that is more functional and reads more to what they actually do&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a Tooltip issue with Armored to the Teeth&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with new Agility Calc &#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.12 (Aug 6, 2009 05:01)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- No notes for this release for DPSWarr, many changes occurred for other models and for the Base and data file caches to fully prepare for WoW Patch 3.2&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.11 (Aug 5, 2009 05:40)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Rearranged the options panel to a series of tabs. Will be using this to spread out all the new systems to be added later (including boss handling)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with HS's not using Incite correctly, also not capping the crit percentage from 0%-100%&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with Slam freq being zero and causing a divide by zero in certain calculations&#xd;&#xa;- Added Slam freq to Sudden Death proc handling (corrects white swing timer)&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Health and Stamina stat displays to a single line (with more verbose tool tip). Re-aligned the tool tips on several others to make them more clean&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed the Strength, Stamina and Attack Power calculations. Over time these had become invalid and are now set properly to match in-game&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Buff system to operate a little differently. When you have the relevant talent it will override the buffs selected. Eg- If you have Trauma, it will remove the Trauma buff and use the Talents' calculated version. Same for Battle Shout, Blood Frenzy and Rampage.&#xd;&#xa;- Trinkets that have Trigger.Use effects now pull GCDs (making them more accurate to how much dps they are actually adding)&#xd;&#xa;- Added a new section to the Options Panel: Instructions. This has 4 sub-panels.&#xd;&#xa;- - Basics: Basic information for immediate, simple setup of the DPSWarr module for your character&#xd;&#xa;- - Advanced: Information about advanced tweaking that can be done to the module&#xd;&#xa;- - F.A.Q.: A Frequently Asked Questions tab to help alleviate some of those head-scratchers&#xd;&#xa;- - Version Notes: The Raw patch notes for DPSWarr commits&#xd;&#xa;- Added Weapon Master Dodge Percentage line to the Expertise Tooltip&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed -x DPS value for defensive talents when Rampage Buff is selected&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Overpower activates from dodges formula, should be technically more accurate than it was.&#xd;&#xa;- Split Overpower from Taste for Blood procs to two separate display lines (and activate as two separate abilities)&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Expertise Tooltip to better display the values and corrected an issue where panel was showing SoA in one spot and not another&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Total DPS Tooltip to show only the GCDs used, not abilities that use 0 (the list was getting too big to keep up at all times)&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the GCD usage of Overpower to absorb 2 GCDs instead of 1 to sim the attack that was used to activate it being dodged and doing no damage and then having to use another GCD to activate OP and do damage.&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up CombatFactors to newer naming convention&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up the Attack table for White attacks and reworked WhiteDPS to operate more like the yellow abilities do (in file and function structure, still uses all the white factors)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Overpower so it's no longer Block-able (as it should be)&#xd;&#xa;- Implemented a 3.2 Mode&#xd;&#xa;- Added Health as a Relevant Stat so you can select Commanding Shout as a Buff&#xd;&#xa;- First round of optimizations&#xd;&#xa;- Made a couple corrections to Ebs's optimization code to prevent null exceptions and show proper info on tooltips&#xd;&#xa;- Applied Astrylian's Special Effect Dual-Zerking changes, drastically improves optimize performace. Ebs needs to review for Fury.&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up a couple more Tooltips&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed bug in Astry's patch that was overvaluing non-Berserking Off-Hand enchants, and causing fury to crash while changing weapons. DPSWarr perf issues are officially considered fixed, thanks everyone!&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Activates for Arms Warriors to be Floored (100.85 becomes 100). This is more accurate to # of times activated over fight duration. It was previously not floored due to rotation constraints, which have been removed. Most characters will see a slight difference in DPS, not major difference. NOTE: Abilities like Shattering Throw need an extra second to activate (will create a fix for this later). Eg- 5 Min cd so 300 sec is fine, but 600 seconds isn't, need 601 for the 2nd activate&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Order of Text on the GCDs tooltip over Total DPS. This lines up better now and is easier to read&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the Ability Maintenance List to a CheckList TreeView, easier to use and more obvious functionality added (Can now select Commanding Shout vs Battle Shout, and it will only allow you to select one at a time. Selecting Fury Stance enables the Fury abilities automagically, and disables Arms. +Vice-versa)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Fury abilities to maintenance (to function like the arms ones do, unchecking it means you never do that ability)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed the Ability activation of Commanding Shout and actually added it's stats to the character (oops). Also added it to the buff override system (if you are puttingup CS yourself, it will remove the &quot;Buff&quot; CS and Warlock Imp Buff)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed the new Ability Maintenance Tree saving/loading issues (oops again)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug where AvoidanceStreak was increasing DPS rather than decreasing it.&#xd;&#xa;- Added a new option to the panel for Allowing the Flooring changed (happened in the last couple commits). You can now turn this on or off.&#xd;&#xa;- Moved some more code to the Optimized method that Ebs was setting up (for uniformity). made the calculators for these private to enforce no outside use. Also did some optimization in the Skills.cs file to make some abilities that have sub-abilities take less memory.&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the Haste system, not sure if it made any calculational differences overall, but it does walk through all the additive vs multiplicative stacking before and after procs.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed some of the melee hit triggering for SpecialEffects, they will have less value now because they are affected by the hit table (landing vs not landing). Also verified that all SpecialEffects are using non-hasted values&#xd;&#xa;- Broke apart AvgMhWeapDamage, there are now all 3 values (ItemSpeed, ItemSpeed Hasted, NormalizedItemSpeed)&#xd;&#xa;- Migrated all weapon speed function calls to the same 2 in White Attacks to ensure uniformity on Slam_Freq adding to the swing timer in all things that need to know this&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Rend to work off of unhasted ItemSpeed (gives positive value to Haste where it hadn't been due to other changes)&#xd;&#xa;- Migrated more functions to Probxxofhit/land to make some function calls easier to read and less intensive to work out.&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up the Skills List in Rotation to list everythign correctly and prevent duplicates&#xd;&#xa;- Added Sword Specialization, this is a new dps line and it procs from all landed attacks over duration of fight, must have 1h or 2h sword equipped and talent (of course). May be inaccurate for dual-wielding swords (but you shouldn't be in a spec that could do that anyways). Sword spec hits are white and should add rage but I have not added that in yet (coming soon). Please note that initial testing has shown SS still has far less total dps with equivalent items than the other 2 specs (Mace/Poleaxe), this was expected.&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Sudden Death to include offhand white hit procs and sword spec procs as hits that can proc SD.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug where Slam DPS was being added in place of SwordSpecDPS (counting Slam DPS twice)&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Slam wing timer delay mechanic, should operate on it's proper per second theory&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed NormalizedWeaponDmg vs AvgWeaponDmg vs AvgWeaponDmgUnhasted for several abilities&#xd;&#xa;- Added Sword Spec attacks to OP procs&#xd;&#xa;- Added Armor as a relevant stat and buff (since it influences AttT)&#xd;&#xa;- Added new Tooltip format for Arms abilities, very verbose now (will add to Fury shortly)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a mistype with OH Blocks&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the Arms proc'ing system: OP, SD, SS, Slam now settle their activates instead of using generics&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed BonusArmor to actually be added to calculations (Devo aura and other similar buffs now apply correctly).&#xd;&#xa;- Removed all References to 3.2 Mode and marked those items as actual (Patch Released Aug 4th, 2009)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with the new Sudden Death Damage on Hit limitation&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.10.0 (Jul 17, 2009 22:27)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Fix for issue 13616 - One-Handed weapons in the main hand with Titans Grip was causing UpgradeList to crash due to the damage modifier being set to 0&#xd;&#xa;- Fix for issue 13607 regarding T8/T8.5 2pc bonus. The calculations still have inaccuracies as to the value of a 2pc set for arms&#xd;&#xa;- Added Relevant Glyphs to Arms (narrows glyphs list of all protection only glyphs)&#xd;&#xa;- Removed Rotation logic, replaced with only Priority Queues (Also changed Fury to a Priority Queue)&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up the Primary Stat display&#xd;&#xa;- Refactored Deep Wounds to calculate at a later time, correcting it's activates method. It is still only about 2/3's effective but better than 1/10&#xd;&#xa;- Considerable changes to Latency, should factor in a lot better&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up Jothay's changes to work with fury. Few random bugfixes (Rage Starvation now computed assuming you're HS/Cleaving, Deep Wounds triggers off of HS/Cleave, Recklessness was bugged and has been removed as it's a paltry DPS increase anyway, Glancing Blows can now push normal hits off of the table and dip into crits).&#xd;&#xa;- Stat Display Pane: Changed the display method for some of the stats and change the tool tips on some as well. You now see both the % gain and the Rating number for stats like Crit.&#xd;&#xa;- Made the Arms Rotation work a bit more dynamically (to prepare for custom rotation priorities)&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Overpower to operate with it's activates separately (Taste For Blood will have separate activates from the Dodges/Parries). This allows it to calculate correctly in extremes&#xd;&#xa;- Started Constructing some of the framework for incapacitation effects (back end only, you will not see this in calcs)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug with Death Wish not being activate-able for Fury Warriors&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.9 (July 2, 2009 03:02)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Added fury support for maintaining buffs/debuffs. Thunderclap isn't yet modeled, because TClap isn't usable in fury stance (additional work needed to calculate rage loss of switching back and forth). Possible that we'll just say Fury can't maintain TClap&#xd;&#xa;- Replaced Maintenance Checks with a new list that encompasses all the Arms abilities. You can now customize your rotation by removing certain abilities (will make it re-orderable later)&#xd;&#xa;- Combined a Couple of the Rage Details tooltips (will help prevent height issues)&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked the landed attacks per sec to take into account gcd users with no melee hits (corrects activates for Sudden Death)&#xd;&#xa;- Did heavy reworking on Latency for Arms, now operates almost like Landsoul's sheet instead of as a percent modifier (which was a faulty method)&#xd;&#xa;- Heavily recoded Heroic Strike handling for Arms, it now activates based upon the actual rage remaining after what is gen'd and iterates the number of white attacks vs overridden ones (Heroic Strike or Cleave)&#xd;&#xa;- Updated Rawr3.DPSWarr so that it can compile with the new changes&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed bug in Maintaining debuffs, Minor optimizations&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.8 (June 30, 2009 11:29)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- We were double-dipping in glancing blows.&#xd;&#xa;- Fury has a rage-starvation factor.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug in racial calculations and PhysicalHit (all racial calculations now come from Base)&#xd;&#xa;- Cleaned up rage info in arms rotation&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Darkmoon Card: Death&#xd;&#xa;- Removed unneeded Damage Reduction field&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed T8-2pc bonus&#xd;&#xa;- Renamed &quot;CritPercBonus&quot; to &quot;BonusCritChance&quot; to be more clear what it is storing&#xd;&#xa;- Many damage mods changed from Additive to Multiplicative&#xd;&#xa;- Agility is now affected by Kings&#xd;&#xa;- Yellow Attacks now use the 2-roll instead of 1-roll system&#xd;&#xa;- Yellow attacks now properly have a different MH and OH crit chance with respect to their expertise&#xd;&#xa;- Rage Starvation now impacts both arms and fury&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed armor penetration to use player level and not target level&#xd;&#xa;- Slight optimization in calculating hit/crit (don't pass weapon item on the fly, instead use MhCrit/OhCrit/MhHit/OhHit)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed some discrepancies in how hit rating works. At this point, there are no known/glaring issues with the output of DPSWarr.Fury&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.7 (June 21, 2009 22:54)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Titansgrip having major negative dps for arms, was a miss chance issue&#xd;&#xa;- Added Heroic Strike back into Arms&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Options panel for handling future edits&#xd;&#xa;- Corrected a couple of Tooltip errors&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed arpen calculations for arms, so Mace Spec and Battle Stance are counted as buffs instead of debuffs (additive towards arpen rating now)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed double-counting of Heroic Strikes in overall DPS calculations&#xd;&#xa;- Added placements for additional war abils, not in use yet but placed&#xd;&#xa;- Added Incite working&#xd;&#xa;- Changed some things with HS for Arms&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Staffs showing up for Titan's Grip (TY Droidicus)&#xd;&#xa;- Added T8 set bonuses (TY Droidicus)&#xd;&#xa;- Added some base type changes to abilities so they can work a little more in sync&#xd;&#xa;- Created a new Rotation object and pushed related functions and calls to it&#xd;&#xa;- Fix in Deep Wounds calculations, and put back in the HS fix from before (merge issue removed it)&#xd;&#xa;- Moved more stuff to Rot&#xd;&#xa;- Added to Rawr3 (Options Panel not ported)&#xd;&#xa;- Realized there was an issue with the port to v3 that broke existing v2 code&#xd;&#xa;- Refactored a lot of things out of Ability and into Rotation, where they belong. Should improve performance (less creating of Ability objects). Fixed bug in DeepWounds where its DPS was 6x as high as it should be :-x New number seems low though, and needs to be investigated&#xd;&#xa;- Added logic for maintaining buffs and debuffs (Thunderclap, Sunders, etc) these now pull GCDs off the Arms Rotation as needed. Also, if you are maintaining Sunder Armor, then the SetDefaults for buffs will enable Sunder as well (to show the dps boost). Still need to make it run the buff add(s) at time of change.&#xd;&#xa;- Beginning to rework the rage calcs for arms to better work abilities based upon rage gen (esp HS and cleave)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Cleave logic (if MultiTargsm use Cleave instead of HS, will create an option to *not* do this automatically later)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Multi-target laogic, abilities now multiply their damage out for # of targets. Eg- MS has 1 for base + ~.13 in a 600 sec Duration for Sweeping Strikes. Next step will be to add Sword Spec logic using this process&#xd;&#xa;- Added Latency (mimicks Landsoul's spreadsheet)&#xd;&#xa;- Added Inback check for Parry&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the Optmizer options, Can now set a lot more control on the optimizer and use &quot;makes sense&quot; options like &quot;Chance to be Avoided %&quot; which if set to &quot;&lt;=0&quot; will make sure you are hit/exp capped including your racial and buff bonuses&#xd;&#xa;- Added a GCD Usage check for Arms, mouse over the TotalDPS for it's tooltip to read how your GCDs are being consumed&#xd;&#xa;- Lined up the COmbatFactors file to better distinguish the ind. parts of the attack table&#xd;&#xa;- Changed the DW calcs to work more off of the actual activates than the theoretical ones&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug in OH Whtie DPS Calcs&#xd;&#xa;- Ported a lot of functionality to Rawr3, but have not activated it yet&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed SuddenDeath activates (latency handled wrong)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Hit Rating (Had it adding to Miss rate instead of reducing it)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a bug in Slam causing it to generate rage instead of use it&#xd;&#xa;- Minor fixes&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed a few bugs, and moved a lot of the GetFoo()-type methods to properties to help while debugging&#xd;&#xa;- Added Parry factoring, affected by the Standing in Back option on the Panel&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed/Added Parry and Block handling for the attack table&#xd;&#xa;- Added more info to the Hit Rating Tooltip&#xd;&#xa;- Added more Rage Calc info and corrected some of it's usage&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed Precision addage&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.6 (Juse 6, 2009 01:34)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Added stamina as a relevant stat&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed PoleaxeSpecialization (was applying regardless of having talent)&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed TasteforBlood so the talent shows it's DPS gain in talents comparison&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Hit Rating ToolTip to show amount of hit can be freed&#xd;&#xa;- Activated background usage of abilities like Deathwish, Recklessness, Shattering Throw&#xd;&#xa;- Arms rotation takes GCDs off for above abilities being used&#xd;&#xa;- Added 10643 armor as default in options, fixed bug in DeathWish, removed Recklessness for now (can't be modeled as a SpecialEffect)&#xd;&#xa;- BloodFrenzy now provides 5/10% haste (up from 3/6%), removed double-dipping of death wish&#xd;&#xa;- Default Stance Recognition&#xd;&#xa;- Better Berserking Logic (needs optimization)&#xd;&#xa;- Default target set to a level 83 boss with 13083 armor (configureable through options)&#xd;&#xa;- Fury Rotation changed due to BT's new cooldown/ragecost&#xd;&#xa;- Added Imp Berserker Stance to strength modifier&#xd;&#xa;- Procs now take into account misses/dodges/parries&#xd;&#xa;- Format issue in fury rotation&#xd;&#xa;- Rage formula modified based on blue post&#xd;&#xa;- Removed overpower calculations due to expertise temporarily because it was causing crashes in some situations&#xd;&#xa;- Known Issue: DeathWish is being counted twice&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;v2.2.5 (May 25, 2009 16:25)&#xd;&#xa;&#xd;&#xa;- Rage Generation bugfix (below expertise cap will now calculate properly)&#xd;&#xa;- Deep Wounds bugfix (damage dealt is based off of number of abilities/white attacks done, still needs more work but is giving fairly accurate results)&#xd;&#xa;- More work on Arms, now does reasonable approximate dps counts. (ind skills may be off but ttl dps should be pretty close).&#xd;&#xa;- Rend now factors for the dmg difference for target hp level&#xd;&#xa;- Corrected DW and some issues with negative rage available killing SuddenDeath's damage (added a minimum freerage given since it was already reserved by the GCD process)&#xd;&#xa;- Minor modifications&#xd;&#xa;- Lots of bugfixes&#xd;&#xa;- WhiteMissChance was being calculated incorrectly.&#xd;&#xa;- Slight issue with double-dipping on damage modifiers for some abilities.&#xd;&#xa;- WhiteDmg displayed in character details is now the average damage for each MainHand swing (previously was unmitigated non-crit hit).&#xd;&#xa;- Reworked bloodsurge to be much more &quot;smart&quot;, resulting in a lower number of procs per rotation. The old system was allowing slams as if it didn't share the GCD with any other ability. The new system won't try to slam until you have a free GCD.&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed OP&#xd;&#xa;- Changed Rotation length based upon Rend Glyph so it consumes GCDs correctly&#xd;&#xa;- Fixed some bugs in GetDamage on a few abilities&#xd;&#xa;- Corrected white-damage glance/miss issue&#xd;&#xa;- Enforced activation of buffs Trauma, Rampage and Blood Frenzy if you have the talents&#xd;&#xa;- Formulaic fixes and some Talent/Glyph improvements" TextWrapping="Wrap" VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Auto"/>

Normally, an ability can have 94.7 activates in a rotation, this allows a more smooth calc for things like Haste and Expertise (due to Overpower Procs). Flooring forces any partial activate off the table, 94.7 becomes 94. This is to better simulate reality, however it isn't fully factored in everywhere that it should be. Use Flooring at your own risk."/>
