Tracking doc for status of Rawr.Tank Module.

As of Sept 9,2009, has support for 3.2 needs alot of validation.

2.2.15:
Pulled Stats object out of ShotRotation so it's not bloating the saved character XML
Fix Blood rotation so the threat values were not so screwed.

Current TODOs:
* Fix defects
* Fix shot rotation/threat modeling.
* Add graphs for mapping Burst & Reaction Time.
* Integrate a Paperdoll vs. Effective Stats model.
